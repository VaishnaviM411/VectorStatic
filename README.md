# Digital Census 2021

## About

An attempt to digitalize the process of one the _World's biggest endeavours_ - **The Indian Census of 2021**.<br>
We plan to **optimise and digitise** the process for easy input and **hassle-free retrieval**.

<b>The Project has been deployed <a href="https://census2021.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</b>

## Usage Guidelines:
- There are 2 Use-Cases: Surveyor and Analyst.
- The Surveyor goes door-to-door to collect the raw data and feed it to the system. We use a Web-App since its platform-independent and can work on every device.
- Surveyor Creds:
  - <code>username: vaishnavi.surveyor <br>
    password: vaish@sur</code>
- The Analyst gets to fetch data using the required Queries to process the data.
- Analyser Creds:
  - <code>username: Kshitij_Sabale
password: Sabale#123</code>
- The Analyst can then Download the CSV of the Required Population.
